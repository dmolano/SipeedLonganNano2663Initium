Reading a table of technical data for LEDs

Suppliers' websites and catalogues usually provide tables of technical data for components such as LEDs.
These tables contain a good deal of useful information in a compact form but they can be difficult to
understand if you are not familiar with the abbreviations used. These are the important properties for LEDs:

    Maximum forward current, IF max.
    'Forward' just means with the LED connected correctly.
    
    Typical forward voltage, VF typ.
    This is VL in the LED resistor calculation, about 2V, or 4V for blue and white LEDs.
    
    Luminous intensity
    Brightness at the specified current, e.g. 32mcd @ 10mA (mcd = millicandela).
    
    Viewing angle
    60° for standard LEDs, others emit a narrower beam of about 30°.
    
    Wavelength
    The peak wavelength of light emitted, it determines the colour of the LED, e.g. red 660nm, blue 430nm (nm = nanometre).

The following two properties can be ignored for most circuits:

    Maximum forward voltage, VF max.
    This can be ignored if you have a suitable resistor in series.
    
    Maximum reverse voltage, VR max.
    This can be ignored for LEDs connected the correct way round.
